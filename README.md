# turtle_car_game

this is the game that i wrote in turtle python. 

make sure you have numpy installed:
```
pip install numpy
```

sounds are only will be played in windows operating system.

changing the values to strange values might broke the game.

i get the sounds from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org)

may be one day this repository will be implemented reinforcement learning for playing this customized car game (actually i don't know what is the name of the game).
